# neural-networks
This is a neural network y to classify the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
Right now, I am using a simple feedforward neural network, maybe later revisions will use convolutional layers or another achitecture. 
I learned about neural networks using Michael Nielsen's Book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning."
